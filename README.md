Showcasing my labs and projects over the years


"Malloc.c" is my own version of a dynamic memory allocator for C programs written in C. I undertook this project as part of a systems software course at my home university, it showcases malloc, realloc, calloc, and free capabilities using an explicit free list allocator.

"Predictive Modeling and Modeling Comparison" is a Jupyter notebook I completed as a final project for my data science class. It showcases various regression models and direct comparison in their effectiveness. It also includes effective feature engineering and data clean up prior to analysis.

"File System" is a collection of code in C++ where I designed a file system with two of my classmates. It showcases object oriented programming and an ability to take on a longer project.

"Latin School Project" is a SQL script where I transferred a hypothetical school's database from excel to SQL. I used the Import Wizard in Azure Data Studio to transfer all records to a temp database then ran the commands in the script to extract the neccesary data and generate tables. Within the script I created a view that shows the amount of times a class has been offered + more info and a view that displayed financial information by year. I also created procedures to add a new student to the database, and to display the course history for a singular student.

"Poker" is a C++ project I undertook with two of my classmates for Multi-Paradigm Programming in C++ (CSE428 at Washington University in St. Louis). This project creates a command line application that allows the user to specify their desired card game from Pinochle, Poker, and GoFish and play them. GoFish is playable in its entirety while Poker is simply displayed up to the flop and the winner is selected at that point. For Pinochle, the hands are dealt and melds that are made are tallied and total points for each player are then displayed. This project demonstrates a deep understanding of the C++ language through the use of function overrides, shared pointers, OOP, template arguments, and many other useful features of the language.
