Showcasing my labs and projects over the years


"mm-4.c" is my own version of a dynamic memory allocator for C programs written in C. I undertook this project as part of a systems software course at my home university, it showcases malloc, realloc, calloc, and free capabilities using an explicit free list allocator.

"Predictive Modeling and Modeling Comparison" is a Jupyter notebook I completed as a final project for my data science class. It showcases various regression models and direct comparison in their effectiveness. It also includes effective feature engineering and data clean up prior to analysis.

"File System" is a collection of code in C++ where I designed a file system with two of my classmates. It showcases object oriented programming and an ability to take on a longer project.

"Latin School Project" is a SQL script where I transferred a hypothetical school's database from excel to SQL. I used the Import Wizard in Azure Data Studio to transfer all records to a temp database then ran the commands in the script to extract the neccesary data and generate tables. Within the script I created a view that shows the amount of times a class has been offered + more info and a view that displayed financial information by year. I also created procedures to add a new student to the database, and to display the course history for a singular student.
