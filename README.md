Showcasing my labs and projects over the years


"StringFileParse" is a program I wrote in C++ that takes an input of the program name and any .txt file and parses through it. It then prints the contents of the .txt file, beginning with all strings that can also be represented as ints. LabHeader1 is used.

"Predictive Modeling and Modeling Comparison" is a Jupyter notebook I completed as a final project for my data science class. It showcases various regression models and direct comparison in their effectiveness. It also includes effective feature engineering and data clean up prior to analysis.

"File System" is a collection of code in C++ where I designed a file system with two of my classmates. It showcases object oriented programming and an ability to take on a longer project.
